You can drag and drop that cItems to include them in the sheet. You can also create your own folders to store your characters, items and whatever you may need.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to create a character?</strong></h3>\n<p>In Actors you must click <strong>Create Actor</strong>, and in the dropdown change \"Default\" to \"templatePC\" (do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> check the Template box) to see the changes). If you drag the cItem \"Creation\" to the PC you could choose the Clan and Predator so that cItems will be put in your sheet automatically, like \"Surge and Specialty\".</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bio</strong> is the tab where you can write everything you want about your character, like pictures, their story, description and such.</li>\n<li><strong>Principal </strong>is the tab with the Attributes, Skills and the things you will use the most in games. Every bold text is a rollable property you can click, like the dice symbols in this and other tabs. Below I'll explain you how to roll and some things you need to know about this tab.</li>\n<li><strong>Disciplines </strong>is where the powers, disciplines and Blood Potency is located. If you drag the disciplines and the powers they will appear in the tables. Below I'll explain too how to roll for the disciplines.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronicle</strong> is where you'll have the Advantages and Flaws. You have to drop them from the cItems folder so they appear in the tables and assign them the correct score, as you must do with the experience. If some character has Haven Merits/Flaws (remember you need the 'Haven Merits' or 'Haven Flaws') or is a Thin-Blood you will see new panels appear to reflect this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will explain now the least intuitive mechanics of the sheet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to roll (Principal):</strong> Every Vampire 5th rolls are Attribute + Attribute, Attribute + Skill or Attribute + Discipline. In the two first instances you have to select the first attribute in the dropdown 'Attribute' and then click in the remaining attribute or skill. For example, if you want to roll Dexterity + Streetwise you choose 'dexterity' in the dropdown and&nbsp; then click in 'Streetwise' text. You'll see in the chat the successes and they'll be compared to the Difficulty (DC) box below the screen you can edit to modify it.</li>\n<li><strong>Hunger</strong>: The sheet will roll automatically the Hunger dice if you have put any Hunger value. If it's a critical roll or there are possibilities of a Messy Critical or a Bestial Failure the roll result will tell you, but in the last two instances you'll have to double check it.</li>\n<li><strong>Willpower Re-roll:</strong> You have to modify the Willpower manually, but when you do you just have to write in the Repeat WP field the dice you want to repeat (max. 3) and then click in the text to automatically roll the dice.</li>\n<li><strong>Blood Surge/Specialties:</strong> If you click in the Surge text you will do the Rouse check. Then you can click the Surge or Specialty check to get a +1 to the pool dice (+2 if both are checked)</li>\n<li><strong>How to roll (Disciplines):&nbsp;</strong>Discipline powers that require a roll can have one or two options, so I designed the system to be usable both ways. To roll you must write in Attribute 1 and 2 the correct attribute/skills/disciplines name, <strong>always</strong> lowercase and with no spaces. There are one exception: Thin-Blood Alchemy is just 'alchemy'. For example, to roll Resolution + Animal Ken you have to write&nbsp;<em>resolution</em> in the first field and&nbsp;<em>animalken</em> in the second one. If you want to roll Intelligence + Thin Blood Alchemy,&nbsp;<em>intelligence</em> and&nbsp;<em>alchemy</em>. Easy, right? Also, anyone with Blood Sorcery 1 or more will see a new panel appear for the Rituals.</li>\n<li><strong>Descripciones (Trasfondos/M&eacute;ritos/Defectos):</strong> When you drop an Advantage/Flaw in your sheet, you can click in the 'Desc.' icon to make a text area appear in screen. There you can write anything you want about that Advantage, like who is your Mawla or why/where do you have Fame.</li>\n<li>You can also create a Coterie Sheet with the template 'templateCoterie', I recommend you give permission to all players to see/edit this sheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>In the future...</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Differenciate Aggravate and Superficial Damage (not possible in Sandbox right now)</li>\n<li>Check Steins in Humanity (not possible in Sandbox right now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And lots more when Sandbox gets more upgrades!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I think that's all. I hope you enjoy the sheet and the system, and let me know any doubs, suggestion and enjoy this wonderful game :)</p>"}
