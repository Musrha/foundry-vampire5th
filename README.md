Sheet and system of **Vampire: The Masquerade 5th (Fifth Edition)** using [Sandbox](https://gitlab.com/rolnl/sandbox-system-builder/) by [Seregras](https://www.youtube.com/c/RolNL). If you want to support me you can do it with the buttons from above, but consider supporting first Seregras' [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/seregras) to thank him the amazing work he's doing with Sandbox.

Inside the Journal you'll find a **Readme** where you'll find a guide about how to correctly use the sheet and also the credits.

I recommend that you install this with the [world.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Musrha/foundry-vampire5th/main/world.json) link in **Game Worlds** and putting the url in *Manifest Url*.

Hope you enjoy this! You can contact me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Musrha) and Discord (**Musrha#8789**) if you find any bugs or have some suggestion.
